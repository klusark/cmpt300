\section{Introduction}
Monitors are a powerful technique for providing mutual exclusion to shared
resources in a multiprogramming environment, because of their ability to simplify the
programming interface for users of the shared resource. They are, however, a complex
construct that must be supported by the compiler for the language that makes use of them.
Seeing as the design goals of C/C++ are primarily based on speed and efficiency of the
resulting code, Monitors are not supported in these languages. 

In this report we design and implement a software interface that simulates the interface
of a Monitor, using the pthreads package to provide the mutual exclusion required. We then
use the Monitor construct to provide mutual exclusion to a hard drive simulator, which receives IO requests 
from multiple users.
